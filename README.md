# Forge Hello World

Sprint report issues macros will show data from your Jira project on the Confluence page. It will show a Sprint Report where all your Sprint backlog items are divided into different sections, and you will easily see completed Items, uncompleted and Items added after the Sprint has started. 

With the help of this report you can continually analyze the effectiveness of your planning, and it will help you to improve predictability and align Completed and Planned velocity.
